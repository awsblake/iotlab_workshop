If you follow the Setup guide, you will have nothing to do. The code first compiles to Lab 0

Your device will boot up, and sends messages to AWS Cloud.

You can wake up the device by pressing the front button. This will trigger a full restart of the device, and device will go back to send messages after a couple seconds.
